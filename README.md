### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I am Student  at **University of Campinas** (Department of Statistics) - Brazil. About myself...


- I usually code in [R](https://cran.r-project.org), and occasionally in Python.
- I am curious about [Julia Lang](https://julialang.org)
- I strongly believe that education changes our lives.
- I'm also an enthusiast of the crypto world, decentralized economy, DeFi, and Web 3.0.



Currently, Iâ€™m studying topics related to machine learning, including deep learning, neural networks, language models, natural language processing (NLP), and large language models (LLMs).
