### Hi everyone 👋

I am Student  at **University of Campinas** (Department of Statistics) - Brazil. About myself...


- I usually code in [R](https://cran.r-project.org), and occasionally in Python.
# - I am curious about [Julia Lang](https://julialang.org)
- I strongly believe that education changes our lives.
- I'm also an enthusiast of the crypto world, decentralized economy, DeFi, and Web 3.0.



Currently, I’m studying topics related to machine learning, including deep learning, neural networks, language models, natural language processing (NLP), and large language models (LLMs).
